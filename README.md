## 🧠 About Me
I'm Liam, and I'm currently a freshman at Miami University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Information Systems. I'm from Maumee, OH, but no one knows where that is so I just say Toledo, OH.  I first started coding via an HTML coding tutorial on [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), which turned into a blog, which I styled with CSS, which cascaded into me wanting to learn everything! I learned and became sufficient with HTML during my first year of coding, but since then I have learned and practiced with many different coding lagunages, such as Java, CSS, Python, SQL, and more. Outside coding, I really enjoy to run, and listen to music. I was the team captin for my highschool's cross country and track programs, and I am now my runnning as the social chair for my college running club. I'm very excited to take a multitude of relavent classes through [Miami University's College of Engineering and Computing](https://www.miamioh.edu/cec/) and expand my knowledge.
