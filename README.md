## 🌼 About Me
I'm Claire, and I'm currently a freshman at Miami University majoring in Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I'm from Brentwood, TN, but I was born in Green Bay, WI, so I always say I went north for college because I missed the cold. May I say, I definitely experience the cold at school and it is nothing like I was used to in Brentwood. I didn't start coding until my senior year of high school when I took AP Computer Science Principles because I heard it was an easy class to get good credit in and I had space in my schedule. Little did I know that I would have so much passion for coding and eventually study it in college! I learned and became sufficient with Javascript during my first year of coding, but since then I have learned and practiced with many different coding lagunages, such as Java, C, HTML, and more. Alongside coding, I also really enjoy physics and the hardware side of technology. I was the stage manager for my high school theatre department all through high school, so I got my fill of technological experience there. I've always been pretty crafty, and I really liked my physics classes in high school, so I thought Computer Engineering was the perfect way to combine all of the different topics I enjoy. I'm very excited to take a multitude of relavent classes through [Miami University's College of Engineering and Computing](https://www.miamioh.edu/cec/) and expand my knowledge.
